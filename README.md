Border colors can be changed after quiting the plugin. Just select the border (shape) and update fill to your desired color.

When borders are applied to adjacent sides, instead of borders overlapping, a diagonal line is generated which divides both the borders (like in CSS). When the borders are of same color, this division wont be visible.

You can also set the border position to Inside, Center and Outside.

Single Border plugin lets you apply borders individually to any side and also assign thier position individually.

## Tips

Using the new resizing options (fixed width / height), you can couple the border with the layer so that when you rezise the layer, border stays in place.
